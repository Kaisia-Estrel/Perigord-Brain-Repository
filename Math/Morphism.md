# Isomorphism
A structure-preserving map between 2 structures that can be reversed by an inverse mapping

An isomorphism is an invertible morphism, hence a morphism with an inverse morphism
$\text{Iso}(f) \implies \exists f^{-1}. \forall x. f^{-1} (f(x)) = x$

A generalization of [[Functions#Bijection|Bijections]] in the category of sets


# Homomorphism
structure-preserving map between 2 algebraic structures of the same type. This also preserves the operations of the structures

i.e: Set $A$ and $B$
$f: A \rightarrow B. f (x \circ y) = f(x) \circ f(y)$

# Automorphism
An Automorphism is an Isomorphism from a mathematical object to itself.

The set of all automorphisms of an object forms a group called the automorphism group, loosely speaking it is the symmetry group of the object.
