# Axiom of Choice
for every family $\mathbb{F}$ of nonempty sets, there is a function $f$ such that $\forall S \in \mathbb{F}. f(S) \in S$

$f$ is commonly defined as the choice function

## Lebesgue Measure
Standard way of assigning a measure to higher-dimensional Euclidian n-spaces

for lower dimensions {1,2,3}, it coincides with the standard measure of {length, area, volume}. In general it is also called n-dimensional volume.
