# Set Builder Notation
$\{ x | \phi(X) \}$ or $\{ x : \phi(X) \}$
- $\phi$ is the rule or the predicate

- Domain may appear either to the left of the vertical bar or adjoining it to the predicate
	$\{ x \in E | \phi(X) \}$  or $\{ x | x \in E , \phi(X) \}$ 
	
- A comma is sometimes used inplace of $\land$
	$\{ x | \phi_1(X) \land \phi_2(X) \} = \{ x | \phi_1(X), \phi_2(X) \}$  

# Hereditary Sets
A hereditary set (or pure set) is a set whose elements are also all hereditary sets
# Partition
A grouping of its elements into non-empty subsets in such a way that every element is included in exactly one subset.
# Complement
The complement of a set $X$ is the set of elements not in $X$
- $A' = U \setminus A$
- $\{ x | x \in U, x \notin A \}$
## Notation 
denoted by $A'$, $\overline{A}$, $A^{c}$, $\complement_U A$, or $\complement A$
# Family
A collection of $F$ subsets of a given set $S$ is called a family of subsets of $S$.
# Multiset
A modification over the concept of sets which allow the existence of duplicate elements
$\{a,a,b,b\}$

# Conjugate

# $\huge \epsilon$-Induction
A principle that can be used that all sets satisfy a given property
