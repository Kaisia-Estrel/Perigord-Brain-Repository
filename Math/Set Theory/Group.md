- A set $G$
- Closed associative binary operation $*$ which satisfies the group axioms:
	-  **Associativity**: $\forall a, b, c \in G: (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$
	-  **Identity**: $\exists e \in G, \forall a\in G: e * a = a * e = a$
	-  **Inverse**: $\forall a \in G, \exists a^{-1}: a * a^{-1} = a^{-1} * a = e$

## Subgroup
Given a group ($G$) under the operation $*$, a subset $H$ is a subgroup of $G$ if $H$ also forms a group under the operation $*$. 
- often denoted as $H \leq G$, read as "H is a subgroup of G"

## Abelian Group
An Abelian Group is a group whose operation satisfies commutativity 
	$\forall a, b \in G: a * b = b * a$
