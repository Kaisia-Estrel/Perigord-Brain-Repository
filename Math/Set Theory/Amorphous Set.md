 A set can be mentioned as amorphous if it is not the disjoint union of 2 infinite subsets.
 
## Disjoint Union
 - Indexed union
	 *i.e:* $\{1,2,3\} \sqcup \{3,4,5\} = \{\{1,0\},\{2,0\},\{3,0\},\{3,1\},\{4,1\},\{5,1\}\}$
	
	It may also be a union between disjoint sets

## Symmetric Set
- A nonempty subset of a group $G$ that contains the inverses of all its elements
	$S = S^{-1}$
## Permutation
- Defined as a bijection from a set to itself
	*ex:*
	$
	\begin{flalign*}
	\pi&: S \rightarrow S \\
	S &= \{a,b,c\} \\
	\pi(a) &= b \\
	\pi(b) &= c \\
	\pi(c) &= a \\
	\end{flalign*}
	$
	
## Permutation Group
A group whose elements are permutations of a set $M$ and whose operations are the composition of permutations.

## Axiom of Choice
Given a collection of non-empty sets, it is possible to construct a new set by choosing one element from each set.
