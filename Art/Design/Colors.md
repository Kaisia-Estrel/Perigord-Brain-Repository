1. **Establish a hierarchy**: Use color to guide users' attention to important elements
2. **Maintain contrast**: Ensure text is readable against background colors
3. **Consider accessibility**: Design for color-blind users and meet WCAG guidelines
4. **Be consistent**: Apply colors consistently throughout the interface
5. **Use the 60-30-10 rule**: Allocate 60% to a dominant color, 30% to a secondary color, and 10% to an accent color
